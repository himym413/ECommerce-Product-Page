## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript (Event Listeners)

### Continued development

I want to learn more about working with SVG's, as I didn't have any chance to work with them before. Seems very interesting, especilly using viewBox property of SVG.

### Useful resources

- [Box Shadow Generator](https://cssgenerator.org/box-shadow-css-generator.html) - This helped me to set up border on images as I wasn't able to do the same with CSS border property.
